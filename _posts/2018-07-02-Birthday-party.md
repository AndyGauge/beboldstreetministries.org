On July 14th, we will once again celebrate
another year God has granted us.  There are
many who live in Salem that otherwise have
no recognition on their birthdays.

We try to make them feel special.  We do this
with as much fanfare and celebration as we can
muster.

This year, we will be at Marion Park on Saturday
July 14th with Sno Cones, Hot dogs, Cotton Candy,
Sweets, and the love of Jesus.  Stop by around
noon and share some love.
