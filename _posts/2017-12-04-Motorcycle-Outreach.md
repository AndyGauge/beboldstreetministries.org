Solutions motorcycle club and Gypsy Jokers of Salem partnered with Be Bold to
collect and distribute much needed warm clothing and blankets.

Approximately 50 homeless and hurting individuals were impacted by the event.

Hundreds of articles of clothing were collected over a months time prior to the
event.  Solutions Motorcycle club collects annually.  This year they decided to
partner with Be Bold Street Ministries so they could personally deliver these
articles.

Reflecting on the event, it is truly amazing who God will use to reach His
children.  Talk about breaking conventions!

Be Bold Street Ministries would like to thank everyone who donated clothing,
everyone who showed up for the event, and thank God for making it all happen.
