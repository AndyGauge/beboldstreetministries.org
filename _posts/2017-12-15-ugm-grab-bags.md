On December 23rd, Be Bold Street Ministries will be going to Union Gospel
Mission to hand out Christmas presents to everyone at the big Christmas feast.

We will be there with Dutch Brothers, who will be handing out Cocoa.  We
can not wait to give a few necessities to help endure the cold weather.

We will be giving away hand warmers, gloves, and candy.  Make sure to join us
as we celebrate the holidays with our homeless families.
