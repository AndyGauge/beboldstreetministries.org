A big thank you to all the donors who have made our trip to the Philippines
possible.

On November 1st, Matt, Josh, Keith, Andrew, and James will be flying to
Manilla and driving to [Calamba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamba,_Laguna)

On November 4th our outreach begins with fellowship with Revealing Christ Glory
Global Ministry.  This is the partner organization that has helped us make this
trip possible.  They will continue to disciple those we raise up.

Over that week, we will meet with the Mayor, enter prisons, enter schools,
government treatment facilities, and minister to law enforcement with a new
message.  The current message in the Philippines is "If you continue to choose
drugs and gangs we will kill you."  

The new message is *Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous
for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;* 1 Peter 3:18

Thank you to [Praise](praiseonline.net) and [Salem Heights](http://salemheightschurch.org)
for holding special offerings to help us raise awareness.
