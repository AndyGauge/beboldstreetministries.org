 We were able to pass out clothing collected by Solutions Motorcycle Club,
 part of their annual clothing drive. Approximately 50 homeless and hurting individuals were impacted by the event.

 Hundreds of articles of clothing were collected over a months time prior to the
 event.  Solutions Motorcycle Club decided to partner with Be Bold Street
 Ministries so they could personally deliver these articles.

  Be Bold Street Ministries would like to thank everyone who donated clothing,
 everyone who showed up for the event, and thank God for making it all happen.
