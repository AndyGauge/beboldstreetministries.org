March 11th was our third event at Cascade Gateway Park.  We've had a wonderful
time coming out and serving the men and women who are not reached by the downtown
events.

We have been able to hand out clothing at each one of our outreaches due to those
generous donors that support our Ministry.  Thank you Value Village for the generosity.

Every time we go out, there are new faces.  Every single person we meet touches
our lives.  We are blessed to develop relationships with those in need.
